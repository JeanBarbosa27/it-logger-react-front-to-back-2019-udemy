# IT Logger | React Front to Back 2019 | Udemy - Brad Traversy

This repository was created to follow the course React Front to Back 2019 from Udemy teached by Brad Traversy. For
studying purposes I just followed the layout and the application idea, but the implementation is completely different
once here I'm using TypeScript (in the course he uses JavaScript); I'm using the most recent Redux approach to
configure the store, using the hooks (in the course he uses the old approach, which has more boilerplate and also
`createStore` function from redux, which seems to be deprecated); and one last difference is that he uses the default
`create-react-app` CLI and I used Vite CLI.

## THIS FILE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Technologies

<!-- TODO: Add the version of each one below -->
- Vite
- React
- Redux
- TypeScript
- Json Server (to mock back-end)
- Materealize CSS
- Material Icons

## Dependencies

<!-- TODO: Add the version of each one below -->

- Node

## Run locally

To run the project locally just run in the terminal the command `npm run dev`, and it will setup both JSON Server and
React application. You can also run each of them separately by the following commands `npm run dev:server` and
`npm run dev:client` respectively.

## Deploy

There isn't any deploy for now.

## Roadmap

- Adapt back-end from JSON Server to have Node with Express and mongo to turn it into a MERN stack;
